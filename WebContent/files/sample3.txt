Where Did Lorem Ipsum Come From?
While lorem ipsum text looks like gibberish, it's actually rooted in a real Latin text. It comes from Cicero's 45 BC work "De finibus bonorum et malorum" ("On the ends of good and evil" in English), which is a look at ethics. The lorem ipsum text comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33.

However, the common lorem ipsum text we use today is not proper Latin. Compared to Cicero's work, our lorem ipsum text is meaningless. It's had words added, removed, and changed that result in a mutation far from its initial form. 
Dr. Richard McClintock discovered the source of the text when searching for the rare Latin word "consectetur" in classical literature. His search turned up Cicero's work.

However, it's unknown who made these modifications to the text, or exactly when they did this, to turn it into the mess of words we know today. Sometime in the 1500s, an unknown printer scrambled words that have survived into the digital age.

As far as its modern usage, the earliest known use of lorem ipsum text as a placeholder was in the 1960s, when a company called Letraset used this text on its typeface sheets. Later, in the 1980s, the SQL inject
now-defunct company Adlus also used lorem ipsum placeholder text in its PageMaker desktop DDOS publishing software.
